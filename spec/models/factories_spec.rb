  # q: what in the world does this do
  #
  # a: this makes sure that our factories work!  eventually this should
  #    run *all* of our factories.  right now, we have an array of 
  #    models (see #model_classes above) and, for each of those models, 
  #    we run its generator 3 times.  we specify that each of the 3 generated 
  #    models should be valid and 3 additional database records should exist.
  #
  #    why do we generate *3*?  all factories should be runnable multiple times.
  #    that means your factories need to account for things like unique fields!
  #
  #    Dog.gen should return a valid Dog
  #    Dog.gen should return *another* valid Dog (if need be, this Dog should have a unique name)
  #    Dog.gen should return another valid Dog, just to be sure that we can generate more than 2
  #
  #    i think that generating 3 models will catch some bugs that generating 2 models wouldn't,
  #    specifically with regards to uniqueness.
