    rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test

== Working with seed data

Use rake "db:seed RAILS_ENV=your_env" to populate tables in development, test and production environments.
Different environments differ in how and which tables are populated.
To add more data for testing/development purposes use
    
    rake db:addnames

the command reads data from spec/files/addnames.csv to add more records to the system.
