= Rails Rack Adapter

This is the Rack::Adapter::Rails from Thin, extracted out

See COPYING for the original license (c) 2008 Marc-Andre Cournoyer

Often times, I've needed this adapter but haven't needed Thin (even though Thin absolutely ROCKS)

sooooo ... now you should be able to:

  sudo gem install remi-rails-rack-adapter

  >> require 'rails-rack-adapter'
  >> Rack::Hander::Foo.run Rack::Rails::Adapter.new :root => 'some/dir', :environment => 'development'

Hopefully this won't be necessary for Rails 2.3, which is finally built on Rack, but it's 
very helpful for Rails < 2.3
